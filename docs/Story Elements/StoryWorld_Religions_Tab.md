### Religions Tab

The Religions tab captures the belief systems and spiritual practices in your world. This is a list-based tab—many worlds have multiple religions or belief systems.

Even secular worlds have belief systems—philosophies, ideologies, or shared assumptions about how the world works. What people believe shapes how they act.
